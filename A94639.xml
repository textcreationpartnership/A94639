            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat the loud and unanimous cry of many thouſands of our fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-Citizens, as well as our own ſenſe and fellow-feeling, hath obliged us to make this preſent Interpoſition, amongſt other your publique and weighty Affairs; We do in the annexed, humbly offer unto your L<hi rend="sup">p</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:160088:3"/> their own words and expreſſions, with ſome omiſſions and few alterations, as they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered unto us by a great number of conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Citizens of known worth, and of appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved integrity to the Parliament; that your Lordſhips may the more clearly ſee the deep ſenſe they have of the growing miſeries and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing diſtractions of theſe times; The chief matter thereof is the ſame with our late addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, unto which we humbly hope your L<hi rend="sup">ps</hi> will ſtill finde the ſame reaſons to give your favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable acceptance and noble regard, as we hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly and thankfully acknowledge you readily ſhewed unto the ſame when we rendred them unto your Lordſhips, as the repreſentative Body of the City alone. The obligation that lyes upon us to them, the duty we owe to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and the intereſt this City hath in the Peace of the whole Kingdome, would not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit us either to reject their Petitions, or to conceal their Grievances from your Lordſhips, neither yet can we our ſelves but both own their griefs and fears, and ſo humbly joyn with them in the ſame deſires.</p>
            <p>But to thoſe Reaſons in which we have concurred with our ſaid Fellow-Citizens, for the more ſpeedy disbanding of that Army a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong others, which hath in the ſight of the Kingdome by Gods bleſſing obtained ſo many ſignall Victories; We humbly crave leave, that
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:160088:3"/> as we detract not from their merit, ſo we may alſo adde thus much, which is daily complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of, That there are ſome Officers, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny common Soldiers of that Army, who ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have never taken the Covenant, or are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affected to the Church-government held forth by the Parliament; That the Pulpits of divers godly Miniſters are often uſurped by Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Souldiers, and others, who infect their Flock, and all places where they come, with ſtrange and dangerous Errrours; And then we humbly ſubmit it to your Lordſhips to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, what ſecurity or ſettlement can be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed while they are Maſters of ſuch a power; and what example, if not encouragement, the people may take from them, to refuſe the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant; or if they have taken it, to contemn the ſame, to the great derogation of that Church-Government, which the Parliament hath decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.

            <p>But this great work, as alſo that which is of ſo high concernment to the eſtabliſhing of a perfect and well grounded Peace, (The bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing home of his Majeſty) we doe humbly and wholly ſubmit, and commit next to the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty hand of Gods Providence, unto the Wiſdome of both Houſes of Parliament, being
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:160088:4"/> confident that they will preſerve and defend His Majeſties Royall Perſon, and Authority, in the preſervation and defence of the true Religion and Liberties of the Kingdome, according to the Covenant.</p>
            <p>To that alſo which concernes the Eſtates of Delinquents which are under Sequeſtration, or are or ſhall be either wholly confiſcated, or elſe compounded for, We humbly deſire leave to adde this Petition in behalfe of our ſelves, and many thouſands of our fellow-Citizens and all others who have adhered to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, That all juſt Debts may bee firſt paid and ſatisfied, and to that end that no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittees of Sequeſtration or Sequeſtrators may interrupt juſt proceedings at Law for recovery of ſuch Debts. And that the Heires and Eſtates of thoſe who have died ſince theſe Warres on the Enemies Par<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, may be yet liable to pay juſt Debts, notwithſtanding any Entailes or Deeds in Truſt, made ſince the beginning of theſe generall Diſtractions, which are conceived to have been made purpoſely to defeat the Creditor. And becauſe of the long continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of theſe Warres and Diviſions, that the Statute may not be pleaded to any Book Debt for not being demanded within ſixe yeares ſince the beginning of the Parliament, otherwiſe there are none in the Kingdome like to ſuffer more then the well-affected, and ſuch as
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:160088:4"/> have adhered to the Parliament.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, We humbly conclude with this Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in behalfe of this City, That as this Court as the Repreſentative Body of the City, hath hitherto by Authority of Parliament had the nomination of the Perſons intruſted with their <hi>Militia,</hi> ſo now alſo we may by Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Parliament be authorized to elect and chooſe fit Perſons for that Charge once every yeare, agreeable to the Practice and Cuſtome of the City in all other chiefe Offices and Truſts concerning their Government.</p>
            <p>And now whatſoever Expreſſions or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires our Cares and Feares have led us unto, or what ever we or our fellow-Citizens have preſumed to take notice of, or touch upon, Wee humbly pray both for our ſelves and them, That your Lordſhips will remit all to our and their great ze<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

And that it may be remembred, That wee and they are thoſe whom you have with your ſelves engaged in one Covenant, to whom God hath given Hearts as well to adventure all for your Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and preſervation, as to be ever thankfull for the continuall protection and great deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verances they have received by Gods bleſſing through your conſtant Endeavours, and whoſe hands God hath ſtrengthened to fight his and

            </p>
